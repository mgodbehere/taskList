# taskList
This is a PHP driven CRUD application that doesn't make use of a database. All the data is stored in an ini file on the server which is then parsed by the app so it has similar funcationality to a database driven one.

## Installation
Copy the tasks.php & tasks.ini files onto a server running PHP then in a browser navigate to the tasks.php file to view a demo of its usage.

## Demo
A live running demo of this application can be seen [here](http://mark.arklight.technology/code/tasklist/tasks.php)
